Assignment 3 - PHP Part 
I will assume that you went over the PHP playlist and know how to use github to update this repo.   
Before you build up on my work, you will find the following: 

1) the .sql file that you should import to your local host before working on it and adding your own so called 'tables'   
2) the .php files for Work Package 1 (products)


What is left to do: 
1) Work Package 2 (users)
2) Work Package 3 (shopping cart) 
3) Hosting the website - most likely wont be amazon like before due to the dynamic nature of php
